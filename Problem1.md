#Question:   
There are 2 user inputed array of size n with n strings each. Check whether if the i-th element of both arrays are almost equal by satisfying the given conditions
Condition 1:
length of these strings should be equal
Condition 2:
the difference between the number of occurance of the characters(a-z) in these strings should be 3 or lesser
if these 2 conditions are met we can say the 2 strings are almost equal 
for each almost_equal strings append "YES" to a list to the corresponding value of their index 
if not almost_equal append "NO" to a list to the corresponding value of their index
eg: s=["klmn","aaaa"] and t=["abcd","qwer"] then the result should be Result: ['YES','NO']
